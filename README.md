# GadgetGrid-Ecommerce-Analysis

# Overview
GadegtGrid is a global e-commerce company founded in 2018 that sells popular electronics from brands such as Apple, Samsung, and Lenovo through its website and mobile app. A little over a year after its founding, GadgetGrid experienced a significant surge in sales during the COVID-19 pandemic, as global demand for remote work and home technology solutions increased sharply. However, as the pandemic-driven demand subsided, the company began to see a notable decline in sales through 2021 and 2022.

# Key Analyses
Overall sales trends
Month-over-month seasonal growth rates in sales
Loyalty program performance
Apple products – refunds rates, total number of refunds, and average order values (AOV)

Key findings include:

Loyalty Program Success: The loyalty program has emerged as a key growth engine. In 2021-2022, loyalty members made more purchases than non-members and, by 2022, spent approximately $30 more on average per order.
Product & Refund Tension: Refund trends highlight a divide between high-volume and high-value products. While high-volume items like AirPods generate the most returns by count, premium products like the ThinkPad Laptop and Macbook Air Laptop, have the highest refund rates, signaling a potential gap in customer expectations versus product quality or price.
